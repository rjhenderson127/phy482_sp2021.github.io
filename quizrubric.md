For the last few quizzes you will write and solve your own quizzes. As explained in class, the rubric we will use to grade your quiz is as follows:

50% credit for turning it in.

1. (10%; required) Student’s quiz uses the relevant concepts to solve a physics problem.
2. (10%; required) Student’s quiz requires using at least two representations (mathematics, diagram, graph) to complete.
3. (10%; required) Student’s quiz requires either checking limits and interpreting the result, explaining a representation in the context of the concept or problem, or arguing a position about the concept or phenomenon.
4. (20%; required) Student’s solution to the quiz is physically and mathematical correct.
5. (5%; bonus) Student’s quiz requires more than two representations to complete it.
6. (5%; bonus) Student’s quiz requires older concepts and material to complete it.

Each of the required components will be graded on the same (10, 8, 4, 0) scale that we have used for homework. The bonus components are all or nothing. So the detailed rubric appears below:

| Item |  | Appears clearly (10) |  | Appears, but incomplete or unclear (8) |  | Attempted but incorrect (4) |  | Absent (0) |
|------|--|----------------------|--|----------------------|--|-----------------------------|--|------------------------------|
| **Relevant Concepts** (10%) |  |  Clearly tests all relevant concepts |  | Tests some relevant concepts, but missing others  |  | Includes concept superficially or in an physically incorrect way |  | Absent, no evidence |
| **Two Representations** (10%) |  | Clearly requires two different representations to solve the quiz |  | Makes use of two representations but one is not really needed (or used incorrectly) |  | Makes use of two representations, both used incorrectly |  | Absent, no evidence |
| **Using physics to explain** (10%)|  | Clearly requires explanation of concepts using one or more representations to solve quiz |  | Some explanation is requested but unclear or doesn't make use of representations |  | Explanation is requested but incorrect given context |  |  Absent, no evidence |
| **Correct Solution** (20%) |  | Solution is complete and correct |  | Solution has up to two minor errors (e.g., math mistake; mislabeled graph) or one major error |  | Solution has up to two major errors (e.g., incorrect application of physics or math)|  | Absent, no evidence |
