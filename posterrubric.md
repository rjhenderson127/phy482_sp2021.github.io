| **Overall Presentation and Flow** (10%) | The poster hangs together and follows a logical flow. It's easy to tell what was done and how it was done. The poster could be read easily without the presenter. | The poster hangs together and follows a logical flow. It's easy to tell what was done and how it was done. | The poster hangs together and follows a logical flow. It's not that easy to tell what was done and how it was done, but you can make sense of it. | The poster is really hard to understand and not logically organized. | Not applicable |
