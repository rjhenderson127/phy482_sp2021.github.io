## Changes to Syllabus
* Pair project is cancelled. One additional homework problem per week.
* Homework: 40% -> 50%
* Individual Project: 20% -> 25%
* Quizzes: 20% -> 25%

Will still drop one homework assignment and quiz.

I will take into account the wildly-extenuated circumstances when assigning letter grades.

Standing on a moving walkway in the airport that is moving at 1 m/s to the right, you toss a ball into the air. You observe the ball moving straight up and down.

I'm sitting on a bench watching your shenanigans. What do I have to do to make my physics match yours? That is, what do I have to do to reproduce all your measurements?

1. Add 1 m/s to the left
2. Add 1 m/s to the right
3. Subtract 1 m/s to the right
4. Subtract 1 m/s to the left
5. None or more than one of these

Note:
* Correct Answer: E (it's A and C)

A rocket is moving to the right at speed $v = (3/4)c$, relative to Earth.  On the  front of the rocket is a headlight which emits a flash of light.

In the reference frame of a passenger on the rocket, the speed of the light flash is

1. $c$
2. 7/4 $c$
3. 1/4 $c$
4. None of these

Note:
* Correct Answer: A

According to a person at rest on the earth, the speed of the light flash is

1. $c$
2. 7/4 $c$
3. 1/4 $c$
4. None of these

<img src="./images/rocket_light.png" align="center" style="width: 700px";/>

According to a person moving toward the rocket at speed $(3/4)c$, relative to earth, the speed of the light flash is

1. $c$
2. 7/4 $c$
3. 1/4 $c$
4. None of these

Note:
* Correct Answer: A

Consider a $S'$ frame moving with a speed $v$ in 1D with respect to a stationary frame $S$. Using your everyday intuition, write down the relationship between a position measurement $x$ and $x'$.

*Be ready to explain why this makes sense to you.*

Note:
This is just to get them thinking about the Galilean transformation again as you will do this with gamma.
