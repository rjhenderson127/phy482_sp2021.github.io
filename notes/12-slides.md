The complex exponential: $e^{i\omega t}$ is useful in calculating properties of many time-dependent equations. According to Euler, we can also write this function as:

1. $\cos(i \omega t) + \sin (i \omega t)$
2. $\sin (\omega t) + i \cos(\omega t)$
3. $\cos(\omega t) + i \sin (\omega t)$
4. MORE than one of these is correct
5. None of these is correct!

Note:
* Correct Answer: C
