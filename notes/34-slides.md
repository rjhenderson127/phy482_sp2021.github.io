Velocity is a defined quantity:

$$\mathbf{u}=\dfrac{\Delta\mathbf{r}}{\Delta t} = \langle \dfrac{\Delta x}{\Delta t},\dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta t},\dfrac{\Delta z}{\Delta t}\rangle$$

In another inertial frame, seen to be moving to the right, parallel to x, observers see:

$$\mathbf{u'}=\dfrac{\Delta\mathbf{r'}}{\Delta t'} = \langle \dfrac{\Delta x'}{\Delta t'},\dfrac{\Delta y'}{\Delta t'},\dfrac{\Delta z'}{\Delta t'}\rangle$$

Is velocity a 4-vector?
1. Yes
2. No
