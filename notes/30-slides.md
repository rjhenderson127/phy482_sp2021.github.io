Two major results of special relativity are Time Dilation and Lorentz Contraction. Please pick one of the choices below which best describes how well you feel you understand them.

1. No idea what these effects are
2. I remember having heard about these, but couldn't define them precisely right now.
3. I know what these effects are, (but I've forgotten how to derive them)
4. I know what these effects are, and I even sort of remember the derivation, but it would take me a while to sort it out
5. I'm confident I could derive these results right now

You are standing next to a conveyer belt that is transporting a baby (don't ask questions) at 1 m/s **to the right**. The baby is crawling at **2 m/s to the right**. What is the velocity of the baby in your frame?

1. 1 m/s to the left
2. 1 m/s to the right
3. 3 m/s to the right
4. 3 m/s to the left
5. Something else
