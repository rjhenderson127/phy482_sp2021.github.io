With Einstein's velocity addition rule,

$$u = \dfrac{u' + v}{1+\frac{u'v}{c^2}}$$

what happens when $v$ is very small compared to $c$?

1. $u\rightarrow 0$
2. $u\rightarrow c$
3. $u\rightarrow \infty$
4. $u \approx u' + v$
5. Something else

Note:
* Correct Answer: D
* denominator goes to 1 because second term is near zero - get back classical addition

With Einstein's velocity addition rule,

$$u = \dfrac{u' + v}{1+\frac{u'v}{c^2}}$$

what happens when $u'$ is $c$?

1. $u\rightarrow 0$
2. $u\rightarrow c$
3. $u\rightarrow \infty$
4. $u \approx u' + v$
5. Something else

Note:
* Correct Answer: B
* plug it in and you will get c; if something moves with c it does so in every frame - constant speed of light

I have seen the Einstein summation notation before:

$$\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b} \equiv a_{\mu}b^{\mu}$$

1. Yes and I'm comfortable with it
2. Yes, but I'm just a little rusty with it
3. Yes, but I don't remember it it all
3. Nope

</section>

<section data-markdown>

**True or False:** The dot product (in 3 space) is invariant to rotations.

$$\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b} \equiv a_{\mu}b^{\mu}$$

1. True
2. False
3. No idea

Note:
* Correct answer: A (when Galilean relativity is ok)

Displacement is a defined quantity

$$\Delta x^{\mu} \equiv \left(x^{\mu}_A - x^{\mu}_B\right)$$

Is the displacement a contravariant 4-vector?

1. Yes
2. No
3. Umm...don't know how to tell
4. None of these.

**Be ready to explain your answer.**

Note:
* Correct Answer: A

<section data-markdown>

The displacement between two events $\Delta x^{\mu}$ is a contravariant 4-vector.

Is $5 \Delta x^{\mu}$ also a 4-vector?

1. Yes
2. No

Note:
* Correct Answer: A
