$E_{tot}$ is conserved but not invariant. What does that mean?

1. It's the same at any time in every reference frame.
2. It's the same at a given time in every reference frame.
3. It's the same at any time in a given reference frame.
4. Something else

Note:
* Correct answer: C

Do you see a problem do you see with $\mathbf{F} = \dfrac{d\mathbf{p}}{dt}$ with regard to relativity? We still define $\mathbf{p} \equiv \gamma m\mathbf{v}$.

1. There's no problem at all
2. Yup there's a problem, and I know what it is.
3. There's probably a problem, but I don't know what it is.

Can we define a 4-force via the 4-momentum?

$$\dfrac{dp^{\mu}}{d\tau} = K^{\mu}$$

Is $K^{\mu}$, so defined, a 4-vector?

1. Yes, and I can say why.
2. No, and I can say why.
3. None of the above.

Note:
* Correct Answer: A

To match the behavior of non-relativistic classical mechanics, we might tentatively assign which of the following values to $\mathbf{K} = K^{1,2,3}$:

1. $\mathbf{K} = \mathbf{F}$
2. $\mathbf{K} = \mathbf{F}/\gamma$
3. $\mathbf{K} = \gamma\mathbf{F}$
4. Something else

Note:
* Correct Answer: C

A charge $q$ is moving with velocity $\mathbf{u}$ in a uniform magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$.

$$\mathbf{F} = q\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{B} = m\mathbf{a}$$

If we switch to a different Galilean frame (a low speed Lorentz transform), is the acceleration $\mathbf{a}$ different?

1. Yes
2. No

Note:
* Correct answer: B

A charge $q$ is moving with velocity $\mathbf{u}$ in a uniform magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$.

$$\mathbf{F} = q\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{B} = m\mathbf{a}$$

Suppose we switch to frame with $\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{u}$, so that in the primed frame, $\mathbf{u}â€™ = 0$ (the particle is instantaneously at rest). Does the particle feel a force from an E-field in this frame?

1. Yes
2. No
3. depends on details
