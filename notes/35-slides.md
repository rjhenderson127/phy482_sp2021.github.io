In my frame ($S$) I measure two events which occur at the same place, but different times $t_1$ and $t_2$ (they are NOT simultaneous)

Might you (in frame $S'$) measure those SAME two events to occur simultaneously in your frame?

1. Possibly, if I'm in the right frame!
2. Not a chance
3. Definitely need more info!
4. ???

Note:
* Correct Answer: B

**TRUE or FALSE:** For any trajectory in a "1+1"-dimensional Minkowski diagram, the slope can be **no greater** than 1.

1. True
2. False

Note:
* Correct Answer: B
* Has to be greater than 1

Two events have a timelike separation. In a "1+1"-dimensional spacetime (Minkowski) diagram (x horizontal, ct vertical), the magnitude of the slope of a line connecting the two events is

1. Greater than 1
2. Equal to 1
3. Less than 1

Note:
* Correct Answer: A

Consider the world line of an object drawn on a Minkowski (space-time) diagram. At any point in that space, the slope of that line is:

1. larger than 1
2. less than 1
3. able to take on any value

Note:
* Correct answer: A

<section data-markdown>

Points that lie outside the light cone for a given event are:

1. accessible no matter where they are
2. accessible for given world lines (trajectories)
3. always inaccessible

Note:
* Correct answer: C

The space time interval is defined by:

$$I\equiv x^2 - c^2t^2$$

Events with common space time intervals lie on a hyperbola of constant $I$.

**True or False:** A Lorentz boost (change to another inertial frame) can allow you to shift between different hyperbolas.

1. True
2. False

Note:
* Correct answer: B
