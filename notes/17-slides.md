The work energy theorem states:

$$W = \int_i^f \mathbf{F}net\cdot d\mathbf{l} = \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - \frac{1}{2} mv_i^2$$

This theorem is valid:

1. only for conservative forces.
2. only for non-conservative forces.
3. only for forces which are constant in time
4. only for forces which can be expressed as potential energies
5. for all forces.

Note:
* Correct Answer: E

A + and - charge are held a distance R apart and released.
The two particles accelerate toward each other as a result of the Coulomb attraction.  As the particles approach each other, the energy contained in the electric field surrounding the two charges...
