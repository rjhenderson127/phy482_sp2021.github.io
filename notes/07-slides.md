In our basic model of a battery, we said that the force per unit charge the battery provides through chemical reactions ($\mathbf{f}$) had a magnitude equal the electric field produced by the separated charge ($\mathbf{E}$). This maintains a constant drift speed across the battery for the electrons.

If the battery has some internal resistance ($r$), which is larger?
1. $|\mathbf{f}|$
2. $|\mathbf{E}|$
3. Both still the same

Note:
Correct answer: A

A metal bar moves with constant speed **to the right**. A constant magnetic field points **out of the page**. What happens to the electrons in the bar (in the frame of the moving bar)?

1. Nothing
2. They move upward
3. They move downward
4. They move left
5. They move right

Note:
* Correct Answer: B

1. Up the "screen" $\uparrow$
2. Down the "screen" $\downarrow$
3. To the right $\rightarrow$
4. To the left $\leftarrow$

1. Yes, current will flow CW
2. Yes, current will flow CCW
3. No

1. $2L^2 vB^2/R$ (right)
2. $2L^2 vB^2/R$  (left)
3. 0
4. Something else/not sure...
