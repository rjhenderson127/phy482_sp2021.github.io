Minkowski suggested a better way to write $K^{\mu}$ is in terms of the field tensor, $F^{\mu\nu}$,

$$K^{\mu} = \dfrac{dp^{\mu}}{d\tau} = q\eta_{\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$$

What are the units of the components of the field tensor?

1. ${\frac{N}{m}}$
2. ${T}$
3. ${\frac{Ns}{Cm}}$
4. ${\frac{V}{m}}$
5. None or more than one of these

Note:
* Correct Answer: E (it's B and C)
