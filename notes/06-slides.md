Recall the machined copper from last class, with steady current flowing left to right through it

<img src="./images/machined_copper_2.png" align="center" style="width: 600px";/>

In steady state, do you expect there will be any surface charge accumulated anywhere on the walls of the conductor?

1. Yes
2. No

Note:
* Correct Answer: A

$\mathcal{E} = \oint \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{l}$

EMF ($\mathcal{E}$) is the line integral of the total force per unit charge around a closed loop.
The units of EMF are:

1. Farads
2. Joules
3. Amps, (that’s why current flows.)
4. Newtons, (that’s why it’s called emf)
5. Something else

Note:
* Correct Answer: E; J/C = V

Imagine a charge $q$ able to move around a tube which makes a closed loop. If we want to drive the charge around the loop, we **cannot** do this with E-field from a single stationary charge.

Can we drive the charge around the loop with some combination of stationary + and – charges?

1. Yes
2. No

Note:
* Correct Answer: B

Consider a pure electrostatic electric field $\mathbf{E}_{es}$; in this case, the curl of the field vanishes (as we have seen before).

$$\nabla \times \mathbf{E}_{es} = 0$$

What is the $EMF$ associated with such a field over a closed loop?

$$\oint \mathbf{E}_{es} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = ??$$

1. Non-zero
2. Zero
2. Positive
4. Negative

Note:
* Correct Answer: B

A circuit with a battery with voltage difference $\Delta V$ is attached to a resistor.  The force per charge due to the charges is $\mathbf{E}$.  The force per charge inside the battery is $\mathbf{f} = \mathbf{f}_{bat}  + \mathbf{E}$.

How many of the following statements are true?
