Suppose you have a circuit driven by a voltage:
$$V(t)=V_0\cos(\omega t)$$

You observe the resulting current is:
$$I(t) = I_0\cos(\omega t-\pi/4)$$

Would you say the current is

1. leading
2. lagging

the voltage by 45 degrees?

Ampere's Law relates the line integral of B around some closed path, to a current flowing through a surface bounded by the chosen closed path.

$\oint \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{l} =  \mu_0 I$

By calling it a "Law", we expect that:

1. It is neither correct nor useful.
2. It is sometimes correct and sometimes easy to use.
3. It is correct and sometimes easy to use.
4. It is correct and always easy to use.
5. None of the above.

Note:
* Correct Answer: C

1. Any closed path
2. Only circular paths
3. Only sufficiently symmetrical paths
4. Paths that are parallel to the B-field direction.
5. None of the above.

The complete differential form of Ampere's Law is now argued to be:

$$\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0\mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0\dfrac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}$$

The integral form of this equation is:

1. $\iint \mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{A} = \mu_0 I + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{d}{dt}\oint \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{l}$
2. $\oint \mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{l} = \mu_0 I + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{d}{dt}\oint \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{l}$
3. $\iint \mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{A} = \mu_0 I + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{d}{dt}\iint \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{A}$
4. $\oint \mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{l} = \mu_0 I + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{d}{dt}\iint \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{A}$
