## Even MOAR

* Procedure for tunring in paper HW
  * Solve one problem per page(s) (full problem not parts)
  * Scan as Black and White PDF (photos vary in quality; mobile apps can do this)
  * We will grade at problem level (fewer uploads)

Which of the following is a correct statement of charge conservation?

1. $\frac{dQ_{enc}}{dt} = -\int \mathbf{J}\cdot d\mathbf{l}$
2. $\frac{dQ_{enc}}{dt} = -\int \mathbf{J}\cdot d\mathbf{A}$
3. $\frac{dQ_{enc}}{dt} = -\int \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J}\,d\tau$
4. $\frac{dQ_{enc}}{dt} = -\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J}$
5. None of these or *more* than one of these

Note:
* Correct Answer: E (it's B and C; connected by divergence theorem)

For everyday currents in home electronics and wires, which answer is the order of magnitude of the instantaneous speed of the electrons in the wire?

1. more than km/s
2. m/s
3. mm/s
4. $\mu$m/s
5. nm/s


Note:
* Correct Answer: A - using kT = 1/40 eV

An electric current $I$ flows along a copper wire (low resistivity) into a resistor made of carbon (high resistivity) then back into another copper wire. In which material is the electric field largest?


<img src="./images/simple_resistor.png" align="center" style="width: 600px";/>

1. In the copper wire
2. In the carbon resistor
3. It's the same in both copper and carbon
4. It depends on the sizes of the copper and carbon

Note:
* Correct Answer: D, normally B, but it will depend on the relative sizes (if the wire gets really small!)

**Activity**: A copper cylinder is machined to have the following shape.  The ends are connected to a battery so that a current flows through the copper.

Inside this resistor setup, (real world, finite sizes!) What does the E field look like inside ?

<img src="./images/simple_resistor_2.png" align="center" style="width: 600px";/>


1. Must be uniform and horizontal
2. Must have some nonuniformity, due to fringing effects!
